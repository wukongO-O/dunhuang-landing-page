            <p>Female polo player - Men and women both played polo in eighth-century China. The game, which probably originated in Persia, travelled to China's capital and there were stables and polo fields in the Imperial Palace. The invention of rigid stirrups, probably around AD 500, made riding a lot easier and, as seen from the Chinese polo-playing woman here, the style of saddle with its high front and back also assisted riders in keeping their seat while grappling with a polo stick.

            <p>Kneeling camel - This strongly depicted seventh-century camel is one of hundreds if not thousands of camels found in seventh and eighth-century Chinese tombs, showing the central role of the camel in Silk Road life. The consummate desert traveller, the two-humped camel of the Eastern Silk Road could survive for up to two weeks without water and could carry heavy loads. One Chinese General is renowned for having used camels to carry fish tanks on his desert expeditions so he could always eat fresh fish.

            <p>Saluqi - The saluqi — a coursing hound — is held by some to be the earliest domesticated dog. It is known from c.2100 BC in ancient Egypt where these revered dogs were sometimes found mummified in royal tombs. Carvings dating from the Sumerian empire (7,000–6,000 BC) have also been identified as saluqi.

            <p>Bone dice - The material artefacts suggesting a drinking culture along the Silk Road are reinforced with textual evidence. Many poems and stories of the period, for example, tell of drinking games and drinking songs, sometimes involving dice, such as the one shown here found in Khotan (the earliest examples of manufactured dice date back to the third millennium AD from northern Iraq and India).
